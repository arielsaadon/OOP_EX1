**This project represents an undirected weighted graph and support the following functionalities:**  
**1.init** - Init the graph on which this set of algorithms operates on.  
**2.getGraph** - Return the underlying graph of which you works.  
**3.copy** - Compute a deep copy of this graph.  
**4.isConnected** - Returns true If all the vertices in the graph are connected (over the graph with Dijkstra algorithm).  
**5.shortestPathDist** - returns the length of the shortest path between start node(src) to end node(dest),(over the graph with Dijkstra algorithm).  
**6.shortestPath** - returns the the shortest path between src to dest(in list), (over the graph with Dijkstra algorithm).  
**7.save** - Saves the graph to a file with a name given.  
**8.load** - This method load a graph to this graph algorithm with a file given.
